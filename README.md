Niez≈Ça Pchanina
===============

You can play it at http://chuj.co.nf/pchanina.html ; I exclude graphics as they are not my property,
actually I stole them from ONE OF THE BEST C64 GAMES EVER, Shahid Ahmad's "Chimera",
(which is a "The Well Tuned Piano" of video games).

The game was written in few evenings as a proof of concept for something something something on May, 2013.
Yeah, procedure names are in Polish, so what? It's one small mess anyway.
I can't even translate the title.

Anyway, the hardest part was making the starfield.
